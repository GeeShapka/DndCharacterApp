This is a personal project I have started because I do not like the pdf I currently use to track my characters.

As I develop this project I hope to add content such as items and classes into the program, so you dont need to use external resourses to find information regarding them. 
This app automates much of the sheet while leaving lots of control up to the user.
One of the big things that make this program better is tabs. I use choose to spearate the character sheet areas into manageble tabs to make the user experience better.
