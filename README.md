This is a personal project I have started because I do not like the pdf I currently use to track my characters.

This app automates much of the sheet while leaving lots of control up to the user.

As I develop this project I hope to add content such as items and classes into the program, so you dont need to use external resourses to find information regarding them. 

The WpfDndCharacterApp has some features like saving and loading, but I scrapped it to switch to Avalonia.
The Avalonia one is just UI currently, but I am working on saving data to a SQLite database
